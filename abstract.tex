"A sensation of heat and fullness is experienced in the eyes, first along the edges of the lids, and especially in the inner angles, but after some time over the whole of the ball." is how Dr John Bostock first described what he named "hay fever" in 1819. Hay fever, or seasonal allergic rhinitis as it's referred to in the medical and scientific communities is generally felt as being very similar to a generic cold. Symptoms usually start in the eyes, but they can also affect the sinuses, nose, chest and general well-being. Severe cases can leave you feeling extremely fatigued due to bad sleep quality caused by waking up with a tight chest.\\

We still are not completely sure what causes allergies, it seems that there are so many variables that it is very difficult to make strong conclusions.\\

The aim of my project was to try to visualise allergy symptoms in the UK so that we can try to identify hotspots. Once these hotspots have been identified, we can look into what exists in that area that could be contributing. Traffic volume, agriculture etc.\\

As an allergy sufferer who mostly struggles with nasal and chest symptoms, I named my project Inhale. Inhale has been designed for use by people with prior interest in allergies, but it is also usable by the general public and is suitable to be viewed by potential future employers.
