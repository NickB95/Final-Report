Dr. Andy Carpenter has been a great help to me throughout the year. Once a week I met with Andy to discuss my current train of thoughts. Many times he turned me away from heading in the wrong direction, so I thank him for that. I would not have kept my sanity without him. I would also like to thank my friends and family for their continued support throughout my time at University. I couldn't have done it without them.
